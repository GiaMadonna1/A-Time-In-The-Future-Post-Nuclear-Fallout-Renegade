    I would like to first and foremost dedicate this project to Obsidian (not Bethesda) and Vernon and John. 

    I drew inspiration for this project from the one who has awakened me to the reality of life some, and has helped pull me from some of my delusions. I have been inspired to better my life for myself and realized that my potential cannot go to waste. So, in return, for you friend, enjoy your very own (insanley good) game where you get to follow Xavier on his journey through the realm of Fallout. 

    This Once In A Lifetime game will have only have the first level developed originally, in which you must escape a bunker by defeating some bad guys and cracking a puzzle safe. I hope you enjoy the game.
